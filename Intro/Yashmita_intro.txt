Hello!
I'm Yashmita from Delhi, India. 
Currently, I'm pursuing B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering from Indira Gandhi Technical University for Women, Delhi.
I'm a coding enthusiast. I code in C++. I started coding from my high school and since then I'm in love with it.
These days, I'm honing my DS and Algo skills.
I'm also interested in Web Development and hence working on it too. 
I've designed some pages for practice!
I'm just too excited to be a part of HacktoberFest 2020!!
